---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to your timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

>The while loop that existed in the method was removed, and we added the thread_sleep_time method which takes in wakeup_tme (timer_ticks() + ticks, replaces the int64_t start, this variable keeps track of the ticks since the thread has been awake) to increase priority to decrease likelyhood of thread being interrupted. The implementation of this method should iliminate the busy wait. 

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

> Looping over only the sleeping threads and awoken threads as opposed to all threads. Within the sleep and wake threads, we're doing some basic list/unblocking operations (probably needs more expalanation here too).


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

> We have disabled interrupts before anything is done with the sleeping threads list (needs a bit more explanation).  

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

> Interrupts are disabled right before thread_sleep is called (needs a bit more explanation). 


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> other designs that you considered?

> The design only consideres looking at the threads that are asleep and awake. Depending on the status of the thread, we determined the interrupt being on/off, being locked/unlocked, the time needed to wake/sleep, etc. Instead of looking at every single threads, we have focused on looking at certain threads that need improvement to avoid busy wait. 

             PRIORITY SCHEDULING
             ===================

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----
