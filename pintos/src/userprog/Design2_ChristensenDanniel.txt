typedef struct process_control {

process_control was added to keep track of information between methods in process.c. This was created to be able to know the parent thread.
---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

I edited the process_execute method to call thread_create by tokenizing the string to get the name of the method. 
The thread_create method will call start_process which will call strtok_r on the name to seperate the command name and 
command line arguments. The load method was edited to take the pointer of the arguments and the file name.
The load method will then take those methods and call setup_stack which will take the arguments and copy them to a temporary char** 
and then reverse add them to argv. While also updating the esp pointer and the number of bytes (to be used in hex dumps). 
Using memcpy and memset, the method will then be able to move the arguments and adjust for word alignment. Finally it will add a null value.

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok() will keep the last part of the string that was seperated to be used internally, 
but this will create a race condition if two different threads call strtok(). 
strtok_r() will set the second part in saveptr allowing it to avoid the race condition.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into an executable name

The shell will deal with the parsing and error checking. This can avoid causing the kernel to panic due to an error. 
The shell can also deal with any complexity that wants to be added, whereas with pintos the kernel would grow which can cause
it to overflow or cause the kernel to panic.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.

>> single process?

File descriptors are unique within a single process. They are created for open files. 
Each thread has a list of its file descriptors called file_descriptors. 

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

The first thing we had to do was to validate the pointers. We did this
by using a combination of the read_usr_mem and page_ptr methods which get the poiner and validate
that the virtual address is mapped to a valid pointer within the page (by calling pagedir_get_page). 

After validating the pointer we simply dereferenced the pointer and used it as necessary.

For a full page the max number of calls is 2 and the minimum number of calls is one. 
The number of calls is 1 if it lands on one full and it is 2 if it spans 2 pages. 
4,096 bytes of data can never span 3.

2 bytes of data will act similarly unless you are aligning it by four bytes. 
Four byte alignment will ensure that the data lands on the same page since 2 < 4, 
but if it is not then you can have a similar situation occur. 

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

Wait will first iterate through the child_list of the current process to try and find a matching child id. 
If there is no child, then it will exit out, but if there is a matching ID, then it will continue. We then
check if the parent process is already waiting, because if it is then it needs return immediatly because we
are already waiting on that child. If the child has not exited, we need to wait for that child to exit, so we
used a semaphore to keep track of when the child is done. We then remove the process_control from the child_list
(from parent) and then return the exit_val of the process control.

In order to help keep the code organized we utilized helper functions like read_usr_mem and page_ptr 
which help gets a pointer and validates that a pointer is on a threads page. The call_fail method was created to make
calling syscall_exit more uniform and make sure that locks get released.

Checking the esp pointer in the intr_frame struct also helps keep individual 
system calls from getting cluttered.

Individual calls will then have to verify their own specific data, but methods like 
validate_str and find_file_dsc are also used to complete common processes that happen internally.e
---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

We implemented a semaphore to ensure that the exec system call only continues
after the child processes has completed loading. Our struct process_control was 
used to keep track of the exit_val of the child. This allowed us to return the appropiate
the appropiate value to the parent.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

When P waits on C, P wil wait for C to exit. When C exits all semaphores and locks
are released. We ensure that P waits by using a semaphore. 

If C exits before P then P will have no childeren to wait on, so it won't wait. 
All childeren's resources will already be freed. 

When P terminates without waiting, it will kill all of its childeren. 
This will free the resources held by the childeren. 

When P terminates after C, all the resources held by C have been freed.

When P terminates after C, then all of C resources should be freed.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

One of the things that we had to do was to check if the address was within a 
user's address space. We used the get_user method to complete this task. pagedir_get_page
was also a useful method by allowing us to validate the ptr in our two pointer validation 
methods (valpage_ptr and page_ptr). This processes validates the bounds and the pages that are used.


>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

Our implementation had a list of file descriptors which means to find a file you have to search
the list. This can add a lot of overhead if there are a lot of files open. However, this allowed us to implement
the find_file_desc method which helps us control how  file descriptors are implemented and used within the project. 

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We used the default tid_t to pid_t mapping because the number of threads to processes is 1 to 1.


			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?
We had one consistent failing test and it was hard to determine what the cause of the error was. 
Maybe adding a way to better determine what is causing a test to fail. Sometimes the stack trace 
was able to help, but other times it would only print a single trace that we never edited and it 
took some time to dig through the code.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?
I did not like the way the project was divided up. It made it harder to answer the design doc 
questions because I was not involved with some of the decision making. 

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?
I think the idea of starting at argument passing is a great place to start (as a group) and then 
dividing the up the system calls would have been better than the way we started the project.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?
not hat I know of. 
>> Any other comments?
